Discussed with Bharath Radhakrishnan - 133050014

In assignment 2 we had used async RPCs for communication. In this assignment we went with channels and go routines, so the paradigm shift caused unexpected delays and many roadblocks that took time to resolve.

completed so far:
	-follower implementation
	-candidate implementation
	-leader implementation
	-election timeout
	-heartbeat timeout
	-persistence of currentTerm and votedFor for each server
	-persistence of log

left:
	-testing the code

Hope to complete by Wednesday 2015/03/25
